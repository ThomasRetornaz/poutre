## Rationale ##

__Poutre__ is a open-source image processing framework, with a focus on Mathematical Morphology.  
It provide a moder c++ interface, genericity, with trying to not compromize speed.
It use hively cpu intrinsics for low level code optimizations.  
The core of __Poutre__ is entirely written in C++, mainly using templatized code and metaprogramming.  
It provided generic code for 1d(signal),2d(Image) and higher level tensor.  

## Licence ##

It is released under the very permissive **Boost license**.

## Dependencies ##

* Boost is required
* Other dependencies are downloaded during configure thanks to cmake ExternalProject facility

## Status ##

**WIP**
