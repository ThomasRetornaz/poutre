abstract = {In the context of software engineering for image processing (IP), we consider the notion of reusability of algorithms. In many software tools, an algorithm’s implementation often depends on the type of processed data. In a broad definition, discrete digital images may have various forms—classical 2D images, 3D volumes, non-regular graphs, cell complexes, and so on—thus leading to a combinatorial explosion of the theoretical number of implementations. Generic programming (GP) is a framework suited to the devel- opment of reusable software tools. We present a programming paradigm based on GP designed for the creation of scientific software such as IP tools. This approach combines the benefits of reusability, expressive power, extensibility, and efficiency. We then propose a software architecture for IP using this pro- gramming paradigm based on a generic IP library. The founda- tions of this framework define essential IP concepts, enabling the development of algorithms compatible with many image types. We finally present a strategy to build high-level tools on top of this library, such as bridges to dynamic languages or graphical user interfaces. This mechanism has been designed to preserve the genericity and efficiency of the underlying software tools, while making them simpler to use and more flexible.},

@article{Iglberger2011,
abstract = {In the last decade, Expression Templates (ET) have gained a reputation as an efficient performance optimization tool for C++ codes. This reputation builds on several ET-based linear algebra frameworks focused on combining both elegant and high-performance C++ code. However, on closer examination the assumption that ETs are a performance optimization technique cannot be maintained. In this paper we demonstrate and explain the inability of current ET-based frameworks to deliver high performance for dense and sparse linear algebra operations, and introduce a new "smart" ET implementation that truly allows the combination of high performance code with the elegance and maintainability of a domain-specific language.},
