What is Poutre?
-------------

**Poutre** is a open-source image processing framework with a focus on mathematical morphology
It is written in modern C++ at least c++14
With python bindings thanks to boost

It is widely inspired from other greats existing frameworks, mainly:
- [MorphM](https://www.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/Morph-M/index_en.html) infortinately closed source :/
- [Yayi](https://bitbucket.org/renficiaud/yayi/src/master/)
- [Olena](https://gitlab.lrde.epita.fr/olena/olena)

Poutre come with:
- a pure template implementation of each algorithm using extensively template code, metaprogramming, multithreading and SIMD intrindics
- a interface layer for thus who don't need to acess templated code    
- and last but not least python bindings of interface layer for easy scrippting with converter to/from numpy

The library is widely tested and i hope it could become a reference for Morphological Image Processing algorithms implementation
